The code Figure 1.py is mainly designed to search and optimize the upper and lower thresholds in a dual-drug cancer model, while the code Figure 2.py focuses on the search and optimization of the threshold attenuation coefficient. Overall, the adaptive threshold strategy developed within the multi-drug framework differs significantly from the traditional single-drug architecture methods. The novel approach that combines sequential strategies and threshold strategies achieves better therapeutic effects than the traditional parallel processing mode.
